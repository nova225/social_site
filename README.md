# social_site
Work in progress!
Working: 
  -Register and login form, 
  -adding and removing friends, 
  -making and retrieving posts on newsfeed visible to friends lists.

First project as part of an Udemy course designed to create a working social-media website such as Facebook, completely from scratch. I used this as an overview of what is actually needed to make a complex working website. Since, I've learned other ways created to ease and simplify website development.
